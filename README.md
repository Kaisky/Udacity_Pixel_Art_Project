# Welcome to FrontEnd study cases and exercises

When you started your first course as a FrontEnd developer you probably had the situation that I went through by having moments like "I need some more exercises to play with some code, etc."...Well, this project has a goal to help every junior FrontEnd developer to have study projects and exercises to play with while solving problems by writing code.

The project contains and will be continuously updated with study cases and exercises from different courses and resources that the contributors went throughout their path of becoming a FrontEnd Developer.

The study cases and exercises are sorted by the source they are related to:

  - Courses
  - Books
  - Hackathons
  - Dev Challenges
